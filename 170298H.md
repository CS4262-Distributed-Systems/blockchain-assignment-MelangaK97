# Blockchain Concepts

1. Each page in a transcribed ledger generates a block using blockchain technology. 
When a block is produced, it generates a unique secure code that is linked to the next page or block, forming a blockchain through cryptographic hashing.


2. After a transaction has been logged to the shared ledger, no participant can modify or mess with it. 
If an issue is detected in a transaction record, a new transaction should be recorded to solve the situation, and both transactions should be viewable.
